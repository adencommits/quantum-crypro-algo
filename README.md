# Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm

## Overview
This cryptocurrency backtesting tool uses Quantum Machine Learning algorithms to predict Bitcoin price trends. The tool enables users to analyze past market data and generate insights into how different strategies might perform in various market conditions. It is designed to predict Bitcoin trends by analyzing historical data, using quantum-based techniques for improved accuracy and decision-making.

## Features
- **Quantum Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes quantum computing principles for higher prediction accuracy.
- **Bitcoin Price Prediction**: Predicts future trends of Bitcoin based on historical price data.
- **Backtesting Functionality**: Simulates past market conditions to evaluate the performance of trading strategies.
- **Data Logging and Visualization**: Logs the results of each backtest and visualizes trends and insights for easy analysis.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously updates predictions based on the latest available data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Quantum Machine Learning Libraries** (Qiskit + TensorFlow Quantum)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **numpy** (for numerical computations)
- **matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **cryptocurrency API** (e.g., CoinGecko API or Binance API for real-time data)
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **backtrader** (for backtesting framework)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-backtesting-tool.git
cd crypto-backtesting-tool
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your cryptocurrency data source API (CoinGecko or Binance). Ensure you have the API keys and configure them in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   The tool pulls historical Bitcoin price data from the configured API. You can modify the `data_collection.py` script to change the date range or the frequency of data points (e.g., daily, hourly).

2. **Preprocessing Data**:
   Use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to clean and prepare the data for model training and backtesting.

   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

3. **Training the Quantum Model**:
   To train the quantum machine learning model, run the `train_model.py` script. This step may take a few minutes depending on your data and configuration.

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Backtesting**:
   After the model is trained, you can backtest your trading strategy by running:

   ```bash
   python backtest.py
   ```

   This will simulate past market conditions and evaluate the performance of the model.

5. **Viewing Results**:
   Once the backtest is complete, the results will be logged in the `results` directory. Use the `visualize_results.py` script to plot graphs and analyze the performance:

   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```
